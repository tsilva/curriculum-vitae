# TLDR

My CV is long and detailed, written for AI to read, so if you're a human, here's the TLDR instead:

With more than 20 years of experience in software development, I have honed my skills across a wide range of projects, from my early days at Microsoft to co-founding Hive Solutions and leading development efforts at Tynker. My journey began with a passion for coding ignited in childhood, which I pursued through a Computer Engineering degree and into a career marked by continuous learning and impactful work. I thrive on the challenge of architecting solutions and driving them from ideation to deployment.

# Intro

Nurtured by the nostalgic screeching sounds of a ZX Spectrum loading games from an audio cassette, my journey into the digital realm began in the pre-internet dark ages, where knowledge was buried in dusty libraries. 

By age eight, armed with only my Casio Calculator and my wits, I began crafting text adventure games, lighting the first sparks of a lifelong passion for technology and programming. 

Moving on to the Commodore Amiga, a marvel ahead of its era yet tragically unsung, I progressed from hacking video games for infinite lives and ammo, to building them in BASIC, launching a game in Amiga Format magazine by the age of twelve. 

When I later got my hands on a PC and a 56kbps modem, with internet access and a voracious appetite for learning, I was off to the races: disassembling executables to bypass trial limitations (allegedly), writing more video games, learning more coding languages, developing web apps, etc.. by the time I got to taking Computer Engineering in university, I was already well on my way. 

Across the span of 20+ years of experience, from starting my career at Microsoft, to co-founding Hive Solutions, remote-working for multiple United States clients and finally settling for a long ride with Tynker, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, usually in a leading role and covering all facets of software development.

In my latest gig with Tynker, I rode the rollercoaster all the way from it being a very small team, to being [acquired for $200M by BYJU's in 2021](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/), and ultimately [going down with the ship](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/29/byjus-seeks-to-raise-200-million-in-rights-issue/). It was a wild ride, full of valuable lessons, where I had the opportunity of being the main contributor to a lot of Tynker's core products, that were used by over 100 million students and in more than 150,000 schools.

# Education

## [University of Lodz](https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/)

- **Duration:** 2006 - 2007 (1 year of)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Software Engineering
- **Grade:** 18 (out of 20)

Took courses on Genetic Algorithms, Cryptography, Neural Networks, Network Services Programming and an Intensive course of Polish language, completing them with an average grade of 18 out of 20. 

The most fulfilling part of this experience was not the academics per se, but that of living in a melting pot of different cultures, with students from all around Europe, and having the opportunity to travel through Poland and neighbouring countries. 

I feel this short stay was more enriching on all levels, both personally and professionally, than anything that I could have found in academia. There's something special about having to live for an extended period in a country whose language and culture are so different, and where no one speaks your language (or English for that matter). You truly have to push through your comfort zone just to get by.

- [Website](https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/)

## [Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/)

- **Duration:** 2002 - 2007 (5 year course)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Software Engineering
- **Grade:** 16 (out of 20)

Activities and societies: Participated in ACM programming contests regularly.European Space Agency's ESMO project

This was arguably the best Software Engineering course that could be found in my country, therefore the entry grades were relatively high. I started high school with a weak foundation in Mathematics, so that complicated things quite a bit. However, I set my mind on that goal, and reversed the trend by the sweat of my brow, and ended up being admitted with excellent entry exam results (2nd best grade in my high school).

The course was very work intensive. Assignments got bigger and bigger as semesters went by, and ended up growing to 80-100h work weeks by the last years. That amount was not required to make the grade, but me, like most people in the course, actually enjoyed the assignments, and wanted to make the most out of them. From making 3D video games to coding and training object recognition Neural Networks from scratch, the assignments were always challenging and interesting.

# Projects

## Help Agent

- **TLDR:** Sales assistant chatbot meant to assist users in Tynker related inquiries
- **Start:** 2023
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Just me
- **Technologies:** React, Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI, Pinecone

Help Agent is a chatbot designed to assist users with inquiries related to Tynker, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.

The development of such a system posed numerous challenges, including content scraping and parsing, data chunking and augmentation, embedding, indexing, querying, post-processing, reranking, model selection, and prompt engineering. Extensive experimentation was required to devise a solution that delivered fast, accurate, and reliable answers without compromising on safety or cost-effectiveness.

A backoffice system was also developed to support the chatbot's operations. This system facilitated the initial scraping of websites to gather data, management of these data sources, and periodic updates from each scraped URL. It enabled the creation of new user-authored documents with the assistance of LLMs, including content generation and summarization, as well as the uploading of additional documents (e.g., PDFs). Furthermore, the backoffice provided tools for reviewing chat logs, managing user tickets (e.g., reports of inadequate responses), and testing chatbot updates.

My role was to elicit requirements from stakeholders, research and experiment different solutions and finally to implement the solution end-to-end, deploy and manage it post-deployment.

Upon deployment on the Tynker's parent and school pages, the chatbot demonstrated a significant impact on user engagement. Metrics collected post-launch showed a higher conversion rate amongst users who interacted with the chatbot than those who did not, indicating a positive reception and potential for further development.

## Block IDE - Arcade Maker

- **TLDR:** Extension for the Block IDE to create games without coding
- **Start:** 2023
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself + 1 Software Developer + 1 Game Designer
- **Platforms:** Web
- **Technologies:** React, Redux, Redux Saga, PHP, JavaScript

Arcade Maker was an extension to the Block IDE, made as an attempt to provide a simpler entry point into game development where kids could develop and publish games without being forced to do any coding. 

This extension allows declaratively specifying configuration variables, how they bind to the game code, as well as define the controls available in the user interface to modify those variables. Along with some other upgrades provided by this extension, developers are able to create new game templates that can be remixed by the end-user without having to touch any code.

My role was to architect the solution, develop the core features, and coordinate of the other Software Developer and the Game Design team who developed the game templates.

## BYJU's Coding Cup

- **TLDR:** Soccer-themed coding competition for kids
- **Start:** 2023
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself + 1 Software Developer (match renderer) + multiple Game Designers (content development)
- **Platforms:** Web, Android (WebView), iOS (WebView)
- **Technologies:** React, PHP

The BYJU's Coding Cup was created as a flagship product to represent BYJU'S role as an official sponsor of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™. Targeted at children aged 7–18, this soccer-themed coding competition was designed to introduce key programming concepts such as conditional logic and debugging in an engaging, interactive format. By coding virtual soccer teams, participants could compete globally, enhancing their coding skills through a fun and educational experience.

From ideation to deployment, this project took around six intense months, with some shortcuts provided by being able to leverage parts of the game engine from [Crystal Clash](#crystal-clash). The soccer matches were simulated as a discrete, grid-based environment, achieving a seemingly fluid game flow through clever interpolation of discretely computed states. The introduction of game mechanics like assigning skill levels to players added depth, influencing probabilistic events such as ball steals.

In my role, I was responsible for ideating the game, architecting the solution, coding the backend engine and APIs, and implementing the whole frontend except for the match rendering and some aspects of the character avatar rendering. This match rendering task was mostly fully handled by another developer, whose efforts I coordinated to ensure integration with the broader game infrastructure. Another key focus of mine was optimizing the game's performance and layout so it could perform well in lower end mobile devices.

Successfully launched in time for the World Cup, the game was accessible via the web and integrated into Tynker Apps for iOS and Android through web views. It has since enjoyed widespread success, with millions of matches played across numerous rounds and a total prize pool exceeding $20,000 USD being awarded in the first four rounds.

## Live Classes

- **TLDR:** Platform for educators to conduct interactive coding classes with students
- **Start:** 2022
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself + Design Team
- **Platforms:** Web
- **Technologies:** React, PHP, WebRTC, Dyte

The Live Class platform was a tool that enabled educators to conduct interactive coding classes with students. The platform integrated with Tynker tools such as the Block IDE and  Tynker course content allowing teachers to seamlessly transition between live instruction and interactive coding exercises.

This requirement surfaced with the need to create a new product offering where we sold small course packages bundled with a number of scheduled lessons where an actual teacher would assist the student with that content.

My role was to quickly identify what the requirements for such an experience was, architect a solution and implement the full stack, backend and frontend as fast as possible.

The solution was deployed on schedule, with just a few minor hiccups mostly related to the video conferencing solution we integrated and a few cases of PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair).

## Quizzer

- **TLDR:** Modular quiz platform
- **Start:** 2021
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platform:** Web
- **Team:** Myself + Design Team + Content Team
- **Technologies:** React, MDX, NodeJS, React Native, PHP

The Quizzer platform is a versatile quiz platform that supports building assessments that interleave multiple interactive quiz types using a simple unified content authoring format powered by MDX. 

The need for building this system stemmed from the necessity of having more enticing and interactive quizzes that could be easily created and modified. Such quizzes would initially integrate into Tynker's content progression system in the form of placement tests that onboarded new users into the right skill level, and later on as assessment tests that guardrailed if users were able to progress to the next education level.

This was achieved by using MDX for modularity, enabling Quizzer to seamelessly integrate with different components of the educational stack, including interactive coding exercises. 

My role was to architect a solution and implement the full-stack, frontend and backend. Having also built a cross-platform native mobile prototype that ran on Android and iOS, built using React Native (the native mobile version was eventually backlogged and shelved due to a shift in priorities).

The solution was deployed on schedule, and remained a core part of content progression for the home user up to the day of this writing, with minimal maintenance requirements.

## Coaching System

- **TLDR:** Integrated coaching management system
- **Start:** 2020
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself + Design Team
- **Technologies:** React, PHP, JavaScript

Combining the [Collaborative Learning System](#collaborative-learning-system) features with the [Live Classes](#live-classes) platform, developed an integrated coaching management system that allowed teachers to monitor student progress, provide feedback, schedule lessons, etc.

## Lynker

- **TLDR:** Real-time messaging server for Tynker
- **Start:** 2020
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Just me
- **Technologies:** NodeJS, Express, socket.io, Redis, NGINX

Lynker was a custom made real-time messaging server for Tynker, engineered to handle a wide range of planned feature releases, from live dashboard notifications to project collaboration and multiplayer game development. It was designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure, with a focus on performance and low latency.

I was responsible for the full stack development, from the initial architecture to the final deployment and post-deployment maintenance. It was successfully integrated into the Tynker platform, being used to power the [Collaborative Learning System](#collaborative-learning-system), the [Live Classes](#live-classes) platform and other features that required real-time communication. 

In retrospect, it was over-engineered, as it was built to support a much higher throughput than it was ever required to handle, as some high throughput features like multiplayer game development were eventually backlogged and shelved due to a shift in priorities.

## Collaborative Learning System

- **TLDR:** Real-time project sharing and collaboration features for the Block IDE
- **Start:** 2020
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Technologies**: React, Redux, Redux Saga, socket.io, JavaScript, PHP

Using the Lynker messaging server I previously developed, augmented the Block IDE to have collaborative learning features, such as the ability to share projects, chat about them, comment on code, and monitor changes in real-time. This application was granted an U.S. patent.

## Block IDE - Version 3.0

- **TLDR:** Major overhaul of Tynker's Block Editor
- **Start:** 2019
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web
- **Team:** Myself + Game Development Team (content upgrades)
- **Technologies:** Redux, Redux Saga, AngularJS, JavaScript, SCSS, PHP

In a major six-month overhaul of Tynker's Block Editor, the core of the educational platform, I independently rewrote most of the codebase and developed numerous features from scratch, focusing on scalability and future-proofing. To achieve this, I implemented an extension framework that encapsulated each code functionality into its own extension with a pre-determined lifecycle and declarative specification of dependencies, forcing separation of concerns.

Additionally, I utilized Redux to separate the UI State from the UI itself, which proved to be a good architectural decision alongside the extension framework and Redux Saga. The framework scaled well for new use cases, requiring minimal code changes across extensions to develop new features.

In retrospect, if at the time I was as comfortable with React as I am today, and version 16.8 was available, I would have opted for a PHP (mandatory) + React + EmotionJS + Extension Framework + Redux Saga stack; dropping AngularJS and Redux, and pushing to eliminate Redux Saga if I was able to keep the same level of modularity without it (it's an amazing framework but has a steep learning curve, making it hard to onboard new developers).

## Crystal Clash

- **TLDR:** Multiplayer turn-based battlebots game
- **Start:** 2018
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Crystal Clash is a multiplayer turn-based battlebots game that allows players to code their bots using Tynker's block-based programming language for competition in asynchronous matches. The game features monthly seasons, leaderboards, quests, and a shop where players can purchase new parts for their bots.

At its heart, Crystal Clash operates similarly to a complex chess game, set in an 8x8 grid arena where bots can move, attack, and deploy special abilities. Matches are resolved within a deterministic timeframe as the arena size decreases every few turns, aiming to be the last bot standing to win. The bots' actions are dictated by player-programmed scripts, executed each turn, to navigate and combat within the game environment.

To accommodate the game's asynchronous nature and the use of Tynker's block-based programming language, whose existing VM was at the time tightly coupled to browser environments and legacy codebases, I developed a mirror server-side virtual machine with a subset of the language's features. This VM processed the player's scripts in order to compute the next game state.

Popular to the time of this writing, several million matches have been played across numerous seasons.

## Mythicraft

- **TLDR**: Integration of Minecraft Editor into a new Tynker course.
- **Start:** 2017
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself (Minecraft Editor) + Course Development Team (Mythicraft Course Content)
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Tynker's Mythicraft is a creative and educational course designed to teach users how to mod their Minecraft world with a focus on mythological themes. It guides learners through the process of creating custom skins, magical items and blocks, and mythical creatures.

This was the first attempt at integrating the Minecraft Editor tool into the structure of a regular Tynker course, interweaving regular intro lessons with lessons that had to be performed in the Minecraft Editor itself. To do so, I had to integrate the tool into the course workflows such that it could be declared in the course data structures, launched when it had to, and inside the course frame, and support lesson completion detection to trigger a jump to the next lesson. Further performance improvements also had to be done in the editor to improve support in the native mobile apps, since this course was also available on them.

- **Team:** Myself + Game Design Team (testing)
- **Technologies:** React, Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI, Pinecone

Developed a web 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, enabling customization of Skins, Blocks, Items, and Mobs. The editor featured texture editing and a block-based coding interface for Mob behaviors, inspired by Tynker's visual programming language, translating user inputs into Minecraft's declarative configuration files.

The project presented challenges in optimizing for performance on older iPad Mini models. Issues with low frame rates and sluggish interactions were addressed by reducing CSS layers and implementing stringent memory management strategies to mitigate unpredictable garbage collection impacts. These optimizations ensured smooth operation within memory limits and achieved optimal frame rates.

This tool was incorporated into the Tynker App and Mod Creator App, providing a robust platform for Minecraft customizations.

Popular to the time of this writing, several million assets have been created by users.

## Tynker - PHP MongoDB ODM

- **TLDR:** Custom MongoDB ODM for a legacy, unstructured PHP codebase
- **Start:** 2016
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Technologies:** PHP, MongoDB

Developed a custom MongoDB ODM for a legacy, unstructured PHP codebase to enforce object-oriented design principles. This initiative addressed significant code redundancy and facilitated the seamless transport of data and logic across the stack, which was previously unattainable due to a heterogeneous table-to-object mapping scheme and numerous database workarounds. Opting to create a tailored solution—completed in just a few days—yielded substantial long-term benefits, demonstrating remarkable return on investment through years of smooth operation with minimal issues.

However, this experience underscored the importance of cautious feature development aimed at masking structural deficiencies. While the custom ODM effectively abstracted certain data model flaws, it inadvertently reduced the urgency to address these underlying issues directly. This approach allowed the data model's problems to persist and propagate throughout the stack, highlighting a critical lesson on balancing immediate solutions with the need for fundamental structural improvements.

## Nihonaid

- **TLDR:** Japanese Language Learning Assistant
- **Start:** 2006
- **Client:** Myself
- **Technologies:** C#, SQL Server, Neural Networks

Nihonaid was a tool I developed to assist in my learning of the Japanese language, namely to memorize the Kanji character set. 

It presented the user with each character in order of complexity, and asked him for the meaning. The user then saw the meaning, and had to select how well he remembered it. The application would use this feedback and feed it into a Neural Network that kept track of how well the user knew each character, and decided when was the best time to present it to the user again. 

This way, the software would only present the user with characters he didn't know, or that the application predicted he would probably had forgotten by then. For example, it would present a character the first time, and if the user said he didn't know the meaning at all, it would decide it would display it again in the next training session. In the next session the user could say he remembered it, and the application would decide to show it again in two days. In two days if the user remembered it again, then it would show it again in one week, and so on and so forth.

With this system in place, memorizing the characters was as easy as simply doing a daily session with the app, since it would make sure you didn't forget the characters you had previously learned, by progressively building a model on how your learning and forgetting curve were.

## Computer Capers

- **TLDR:** Adventure Game for the Commodore Amiga
- **Start:** 1996
- **Client:** Me
- **Technologies:** AMOS Basic

Computer Capers was a video game I developed when I was 12 years old and sent for a monthly competition on the Amiga Format magazine.

The whole game plot was incredibly dumb, which was natural for my age. The mechanics were very simple, you just walked around a tile-based world, talking to people who were looking for certain items, and when you found and gave them those items, they rewarded you with other items that other people were looking for, which let you advance the plot. The game graphics were created by me as well.
