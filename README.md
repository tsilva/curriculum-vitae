# TLDR

This CV is detailed and comprehensive—it's more suited for running through your favorite LLM and asking questions than reading it all the way through. For a concise summary, here's the **TL;DR**:


>👋 As a **Software Engineer** with over **20+ years of experience** and **60+ projects shipped**, my passion for technology began in childhood. My earliest memories are of playing on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0EfycbDhiw" target="_blank">Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k</a> (`LOAD "" [ENTER]` anyone? 🎮) and later learning English by trial and error while navigating graphical adventure games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBeYlClQRgQ" target="_blank">The Secret of Monkey Island</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500" target="_blank">Commodore Amiga 500</a>. My home became the go-to spot for neighborhood friends to binge on video games for hours 🎮🕹, and when we got stuck, I would trace where game variables were stored in RAM to patch them for infinite lives (`0x00057A34 = 03 -> FF` 💻🔧😈). At age 8, I received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-850P" target="_blank">Casio FX-850P calculator</a>—my first portable computer—and began coding text adventures on it to share with friends. By age 12, I had submitted <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/uMKFMcYurDnpCged8" target="_blank">my first game</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Format" target="_blank">Amiga Format magazine</a>, and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/usD9rmawFdXKwFcH8" target="_blank">positive feedback</a> from the reviewer was encouraging enough to kickstart my journey into pursuing Software Engineering.<br>
><br>🚀 Over the past two decades, I’ve fully committed to three major roles—starting at <a href="#-microsoft">Microsoft</a>, co-founding <a href="#-hive-solutions">Hive Solutions</a> 🐝, and leading software development at <a href="#-tynker">Tynker</a> 💡.

# 🎓 Education

## 📚 <a href="https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/" target="_blank">University of Lodz</a>

- **Duration:** 2006 - 2007 (one semester)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Computer Engineering
- **Grade:** 18 (out of 20)
- **Location:** Lodz, Poland

During my <a href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/studying-abroad" target="_blank">Erasmus</a> exchange, which took place in the final year of my Computer Engineering studies at <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial" target="_blank">FEUP</a>, I enrolled in courses on Genetic Algorithms, Cryptography, Neural Networks, Network Services Programming, and an intensive Polish language course. I successfully completed them with an average grade of 18 out of 20.

However, the most rewarding aspect of this experience extended far beyond academics. Living in a diverse cultural melting pot, alongside students from across Europe, and having the chance to travel throughout Poland and neighboring countries, proved to be incredibly enriching. This brief but immersive experience provided personal and professional growth that far exceeded what I could have gained from traditional academic settings.

Being in a country with a language and culture so different from my own, where communication was often challenging (as neither Polish nor English were widely spoken), pushed me out of my comfort zone every day. It was a profoundly transformative experience that fostered resilience and adaptability in ways I hadn't anticipated.

## 🎓 <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/" target="_blank">Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto</a>

- **Duration:** 2002 - 2007 (5 year course)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Computer Engineering
- **Grade:** 16 (out of 20)
- **Location:** Porto, Portugal · Onsite 🏢

The Computer Engineering course I attended was one of the most competitive in the country, with high entry requirements. Despite starting with a weak foundation in Mathematics, I worked hard to turn things around, achieving excellent entry exam results and earning the second-highest grade in my high school.

The course itself was demanding, with assignments becoming more complex each semester. By the final years, I dedicated 80-100 hours a week, not because it was required, but because I genuinely enjoyed the work. From creating 3D video games to developing neural networks, the challenges were both intense and rewarding.

Additionally, I regularly participated in ACM programming contests, placed second in the 2006 edition of the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagoafpereira/albums/72057594128921562/" target="_blank">National Logic and Functional Programming Contest</a>, and was involved in the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Education/ESMO_mission" target="_blank">European Space Agency's ESMO project</a>.

## 🧩 <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rLjp8tBGs6WNStA18" target="_blank">Block IDE - Version 3.0</a>

- **TLDR:** Major overhaul of Tynker's Block Editor
- **Start:** 2019
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Location:** Mountain View, California · Remote 🌍
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web
- **Team:** Me + Game Development Team (content upgrades)
- **Technologies:** Redux, Redux Saga, AngularJS, JavaScript, SCSS, PHP

In six months, I rearchitected a significant portion of Tynker's Block Editor, the core of its educational platform, to address critical scalability and maintenance issues caused by years of rushed development under tight deadlines, which had left the legacy codebase cluttered with hardcoded elements and quick-fix hacks, making it difficult to scale and maintain.

I implemented a new architecture based on a custom-built extension framework, Redux for state management, and Redux Saga for handling side effects. This solution improved scalability and future-proofed the platform. The extension framework modularized functionality, enforced separation of concerns, and introduced a clear lifecycle with declarative dependency management, significantly reducing maintenance overhead and simplifying feature additions. Redux decoupled UI state from the UI, and alongside the extension framework and Redux Saga, it streamlined scaling and enabled new features to be introduced with minimal changes across modules.

Looking back, a stack using PHP (for legacy reasons) + React (particularly with the release of React 16.8) + EmotionJS + the Extension Framework would have been more efficient. React could have replaced AngularJS, simplifying state management and eliminating the need for Redux. While Redux Saga was powerful, its steep learning curve for new developers would have made simpler alternatives preferable.

## 🤖 <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/h8BPE44JqYkjCFnT9" target="_blank">Crystal Clash</a>

- **TLDR:** Multiplayer turn-based battlebots game
- **Start:** 2018
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Location:** Mountain View, California · Remote 🌍
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Crystal Clash is a multiplayer, turn-based battlebots game where players program their bots using Tynker's block-based programming language to compete in asynchronous matches. The game features monthly seasons, leaderboards, quests, and a shop where players can purchase new bot parts.

The core gameplay is similar to chess, taking place on an 8x8 grid arena where bots move, attack, and use special abilities. Matches are deterministic and the arena shrinks over time, with the objective of being the last bot standing. Players' bots follow scripts they code, which dictate their actions each turn.

To support the asynchronous gameplay and integrate Tynker's block-based programming language—originally designed for browser environments—I developed a server-side virtual machine that mirrors a subset of Tynker's features. This VM processes players' scripts to compute the game's next state.

Since its release, millions of matches have been played across numerous seasons.

- **Location:** Mountain View, California · Remote 🌍
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Me (Minecraft Editor) + Course Development Team (Mythicraft Course Content)
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Tynker's Mythicraft is a creative educational course designed to teach users how to mod their Minecraft world with a focus on mythological themes. It guides learners through the creation of custom skins, magical items, blocks, and mythical creatures.

This course marked the first integration of the Minecraft Editor tool into a standard Tynker course structure, blending traditional introductory lessons with those requiring the Minecraft Editor. To achieve this, I integrated the tool into the course workflows, enabling it to be declared in the course data structures, launched at the appropriate times, and embedded within the course frame. I also implemented lesson completion detection to trigger progression to the next lesson. Additionally, I optimized the editor's performance to enhance its functionality on native mobile apps, as the course was available on those platforms as well.

## 🧱 <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7PtgswT8BT2jcXnR9" target="_blank">Minecraft Editor</a>

- **TLDR:** Web 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition
- **Start:** 2016
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Location:** Mountain View, California · Remote 🌍
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Me + Game Design Team (testing)
- **Technologies:** React, Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI, Pinecone

Developed a web-based 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, allowing users to customize Skins, Blocks, Items, and Mobs. The editor included texture editing capabilities and a block-based coding interface for Mob behaviors, inspired by Tynker's visual programming language, which translated user inputs into Minecraft's declarative configuration files.

A key challenge was optimizing performance on older iPad Mini models, where low frame rates and sluggish interactions were prevalent. To address this, I made sure I bypassed GPU compositing operations as much as possible, and implemented strict memory management strategies to mitigate the effects of unpredictable garbage collection. These optimizations ensured the editor ran smoothly within memory limits, achieving optimal frame rates.

The tool was integrated into both the Tynker App and the Mod Creator App (which <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KDZMd8qAxy5TeSHx8">reached top 3 in different App Store categories</a>), providing a powerful platform for Minecraft customizations. As of this writing, users have created several million assets using the editor.

## 🥋 <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nihonaid/" target="_blank">Nihonaid</a>

- **TLDR:** Japanese Language Learning Assistant
- **Start:** 2006
- **Client:** Me
- **Location:** Porto, Portugal
- **Technologies:** C#, SQL Server, Neural Networks

Nihonaid is a tool I developed to assist with learning Japanese, specifically for memorizing the Kanji character set.

The app presented each character in order of complexity, prompting the user for its meaning. After revealing the correct meaning, the user would rate how well they remembered it. This feedback was processed by a Neural Network, which tracked the user's knowledge of each character and determined the optimal time to reintroduce it for review.

The system focused on characters the user either didn't know or was predicted to have forgotten. For example, if a user didn't recognize a character, the app would present it again in the next session. If the user remembered it, the app would space out the reviews progressively, showing it again in two days, then a week, and so on.

With this system, daily sessions ensured the user retained previously learned characters, as the app adapted to their individual learning and forgetting curve.
