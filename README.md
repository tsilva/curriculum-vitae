# Curriculum Vitae

HEY YOU! Yes, I'm talking to you! Why are you looking at my profile? Just snooping around? Or are you looking for a Software Developer you can trust to turn your technical vision into the stuff reality is made of? If so, look no further! Here's why:

1 - In real life, I'm actually not a self-aggrandising solipsistic jerk like I portrayed myself in the previous paragraph, I just wanted to grab your attention.

2 - I've been coding since I was 8 years old, cheating my way through video games by manually modifying memory slots before that age (with Action Replay hardware), and even got a small video game published in a then distinguished magazine (Amiga Format) when I was 12 years old. My first childhood memory actually involves a ZX Spectrum (Freud would have a field day with this one). Long story short, I've been around computers for a while.

3 - For me, Software Development is a true art form. Don't know why, but I'm totally obsessed about making the cleanest and most organised code that I can. However, paradoxically, I hate missing my goals, so I take deadlines very seriously. To strike a balance between these two antagonists, I'm constantly finding ways where I can trim down repetitive tasks to save time.

# Education

## [University of Lodz](https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/)

**Degree:** Licenciate, Software Engineering
**Duration:** 2006 - 2007 (1 year of)
**Grade:** 18 (out of 20)

Took on Genetic Algorithms, Cryptography, Neural Networks, Network Services Programming and an Intensive course of Polish language, completing them with an average grade of 18 out of 20. 
However, the most enriching part of this experience was not the academics per se, but that of living in a melting pot of different cultures, with students from all around Europe, and having the opportunity to travel through Poland and neighbouring countries. 

I feel this short stay was more enriching on all levels, both personally and professionally, than anything that I could have found in academia. There's something special about having to live for an extended period in a country whose language and culture are so different, and where almost no one communicates in your language (or English for that matter). You truly have to transcend your comfort zone just to get by, and having to do so was one of the most enriching experiences of my life.

This was arguably the best such course that could be found in my country, therefore the entry grades were relatively high. I started high school with a weak foundation in Mathemathics, so that complicated things quite a bit. However, I set my mind on that goal, put a picture of that Faculty on my study desk, and reversed the trend by the sweat of my brow, and ended up being admitted with excellent entry exam results.

The course was very work intensive. Assignments got bigger and bigger as semesters went by, and ended up growing to 14 hour study/work days by the last years. That amount was not required to make the grade, but me, like most people in the course, actually enjoyed the assignments, and wanted to make the most out of them. Making a 3D Video Game or a Neural Network that could distinguish objects when pointing a camera at them, and the all-nighters required to pull them off, are some of the assignments I vividly remember to this day.

# Projects

## Tynker - PHP MongoDB ODM

**Employer:** Tynker

Developed a custom MongoDB ODM for a legacy, unstructured PHP codebase to enforce object-oriented design principles. This initiative addressed significant code redundancy and facilitated the seamless transport of data and logic across the stack, which was previously unattainable due to a heterogeneous table-to-object mapping scheme and numerous database workarounds. Opting to create a tailored solution—completed in just a few days—yielded substantial long-term benefits, demonstrating remarkable return on investment through years of smooth operation with minimal issues.

However, this experience underscored the importance of cautious feature development aimed at masking structural deficiencies. While the custom ODM effectively abstracted certain data model flaws, it inadvertently reduced the urgency to address these underlying issues directly. This approach allowed the data model's problems to persist and propagate throughout the stack, highlighting a critical lesson on balancing immediate solutions with the need for fundamental structural improvements.

## [Tynker - Minecraft Editor](https://www.tynker.com/minecraft/editor/mob/pig/)

**Employer:** Tynker

Developed a web 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, enabling customization of Skins, Blocks, Items, and Mobs. The editor featured texture editing and a block-based coding interface for Mob behaviors, inspired by Tynker's visual programming language, translating user inputs into Minecraft's declarative configuration files.

The project presented challenges in optimizing for performance on older iPad Mini models. Issues with low frame rates and sluggish interactions were addressed by reducing CSS layers and implementing stringent memory management strategies to mitigate unpredictable garbage collection impacts. These optimizations ensured smooth operation within memory limits and achieved optimal frame rates.

This tool was incorporated into the Tynker App and Mod Creator App, providing a robust platform for Minecraft customizations.

## [Block IDE - Major redesign/overhaul](https://www.tynker.com/ide/v3)

**Employer:** Tynker
**Platforms:** Web
**Technologies:** PHP, Javascript, Redux, Redux Saga, AngularJS, SCSS

Performed a major overhaul of Tynker's Block Editor, at that time, the core of Tynker's educational platform, mostly alone, in the span of six months. Given the previous mistakes and the undefined nature of the project, where this tool could keep growing to more and more unknown use cases, started by defining an architecture that forced separation of concerns, since this was the previous version's biggest mistake. To do that, first developed an extension framework where every part of the codebase was encapsulated in an extension, which could specify its dependencies. This approach forced all code to be encapsulated in an extension, which had a pre-determined lifecycle, and forced declaritve specification of dependencies. The second big decision was to use Redux. Redux forces a separation of concerns between the UI State and the UI itself, while also

This project was a behemoth, it involved writing a lot of features from scratch. The ones that I barely touch were the very core, namely the VM and the Block Rendering.

Team: All software development tasks were architected and performed by me. There was also a significant effort to upgrade some curriculum to the new version, which was done by the game development team.
Looking back: Looking back I still think the extension framework and Redux Saga were good architectural decisions. The framework scaled great for new use cases, where most of the time one had only to create a new extension and perform minimal code changes across the others to develop the new feature. Coding with Redux Saga requires a paradigm shift and it was hard to onboard new people because of it. If I was comfortable with React at that time, and if version X was already available, I would just swap the whole stack with PHP + React + EmotionJS + Extension Framework + Redux Saga, and make a strong push for getting rid of Redux Saga completely if I was able to keep the application modular without it.

## Lynker

**Employer:** Tynker
**Technologies:** NodeJS, Express, socket.io, Redis, NGINX

For the Lynker server project at Tynker, designed as a versatile messaging server to support multiple real-time collaboration and notification scenarios. It enables clients to subscribe to channels for receiving messages, tailored for use cases like live dashboard notifications, project collaboration feeds, and multiplayer game prototyping. Built with a focus on real-time updates, the server integrates technologies such as PM2 for process management, Nginx for load balancing, Redis for message queuing, and MongoDB for data persistence. The architecture supports multi-tenancy, ensuring scalability and flexibility across development and production environments. Authentication is handled via signed data from Tynker's API, ensuring secure access to channels based on user roles and permissions. Although the server demonstrates robust capabilities in live scenarios, future improvements include transitioning from Socket.io to native WebSockets for enhanced performance and discontinuing status channels for streamlined server operations.

## [Nihonaid (Japanese Language Learning Assistant)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nihonaid/)

**Start:** Jan 2006
**Technologies:** C#, SQL Server, Neural Networks

Nihonaid was a tool I developed to assist in my learning of the Japanese language, namely to memorize the Kanji character set. 

It presented the user with each character in order of complexity, and asked him for the meaning. The user then saw the meaning, and had to select how well he remembered it. The application would use this feedback and feed it into a Neural Network that kept track of how well the user new each character, and decided when was the best time to present it to the user again. 

This way, the software would only present the user with characters he didn't know, or that the application predicted he would probably had forgotten by then. For example, it would present a character the first time, and if the user said he didn't know the meaning at all, it would decide it would display it again in the next training session. In the next session the user could say he remembered it, and the application would decide to show it again in two days. In two days if the user remembered it again, then it would show it again in one week, and so on and so forth.

With this system in place, memorizing the characters was as easy as simply doing a daily session with the app, since it would make sure you didn't forget the characters you had previously learned, by progressively building a model on how your learning and forgetting curve were.

## Computer Capers (Adventure Game for the Commodore Amiga)

**Start:** Jan 1996
**Technologies:** AMOS Basic

Computer Capers was a video game I developed when I was 12 years old and sent for a monthly competition on the Amiga Format magazine.

The whole game plot was incredibly dumb, which was natural for my age. The mechanics were very simple, you just walked around a tile-based world, talking to people who were looking for certain items, and when you found and gave them those items, they rewarded you with other items that other people were looking for, which let you advance the plot. The game graphics were created by me as well.
