# Intro

Nurtured by the nostalgic screeching sounds of a [Sinclair ZX Spectrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0EfycbDhiw) loading games from an audio cassette, my journey into the digital realm began in the pre-internet dark ages, where knowledge was buried in dusty libraries. 

By age eight, armed with only a [Casio FX-850P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-850P) and my wits, I began crafting text adventure games, lighting the first sparks of a lifelong passion for technology and programming. 

Moving on to the [Commodore Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga), a marvel ahead of its era yet tragically unsung, I progressed from hacking video games for infinite lives and ammo, to building them in [Amos BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_(programming_language)), having a game published in [Amiga Format magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Format) by the age of twelve. 

When I later got my hands on a PC and a 56kbps modem, with internet access and a voracious appetite for learning, I was off to the races: disassembling executables to bypass trial limitations (allegedly), writing more video games, learning more coding languages, developing web apps, etc.. by the time I got to taking Computer Engineering in university, I was already well on my way. 

Across the span of 20+ years of experience, from starting my career at Microsoft, to co-founding Hive Solutions, remote-working for multiple United States clients and finally settling for a long ride with Tynker, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, usually in a leading role and covering all facets of software development.

In my latest role with Tynker, I rode the rollercoaster all the way from it being a very small team, to being [acquired for $200M by BYJU's in 2021](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/), and ultimately [going down with the ship](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/29/byjus-seeks-to-raise-200-million-in-rights-issue/). It was a wild ride, full of valuable lessons, where I had the opportunity of being the main contributor to a lot of Tynker's core products, that were used by over 100 million students and in more than 150,000 schools.

# Education

## [University of Lodz](https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/)

- **Duration:** 2006 - 2007 (one semester)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Computer Engineering
- **Grade:** 18 (out of 20)

During my [Erasmus](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/studying-abroad) exchange, which took place in the final year of my Computer Engineering studies at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial), I enrolled in courses on Genetic Algorithms, Cryptography, Neural Networks, Network Services Programming, and an intensive Polish language course. I successfully completed them with an average grade of 18 out of 20.

However, the most rewarding aspect of this experience extended far beyond academics. Living in a diverse cultural melting pot, alongside students from across Europe, and having the chance to travel throughout Poland and neighboring countries, proved to be incredibly enriching. This brief but immersive experience provided personal and professional growth that far exceeded what I could have gained from traditional academic settings.

Being in a country with a language and culture so different from my own, where communication was often challenging (as neither Polish nor English were widely spoken), pushed me out of my comfort zone every day. It was a profoundly transformative experience that fostered resilience and adaptability in ways I hadn't anticipated.

- [Website](https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/)

## [Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/)

- **Duration:** 2002 - 2007 (5 year course)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Computer Engineering
- **Grade:** 16 (out of 20)

The Computer Engineering course I attended was one of the most competitive in the country, with high entry requirements. Despite starting with a weak foundation in Mathematics, I worked hard to turn things around, achieving excellent entry exam results and earning the second-highest grade in my high school.

The course itself was demanding, with assignments becoming more complex each semester. By the final years, I dedicated 80-100 hours a week, not because it was required, but because I genuinely enjoyed the work. From creating 3D video games to developing neural networks, the challenges were both intense and rewarding.

Additionally, I regularly participated in ACM programming contests, placed second in the 2006 edition of the [National Logic and Functional Programming Contest](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagoafpereira/albums/72057594128921562/), and was involved in the [European Space Agency's ESMO project](https://www.esa.int/Education/ESMO_mission).

# Projects

## Help Agent

- **TLDR:** Sales assistant chatbot meant to assist users in Tynker related inquiries
- **Start:** 2023
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Just me
- **Technologies:** React, Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI, Pinecone

Help Agent was a chatbot developed to assist users with Tynker-related inquiries, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.

The project involved challenges like content scraping, data augmentation, embedding, indexing, querying, reranking, model selection, and prompt engineering. Extensive experimentation was required to ensure fast, accurate, and reliable responses while balancing safety and cost-effectiveness (less of an issue now, as LLMs have become cheaper and more reliable).

A backoffice system supported the chatbot by handling data scraping, updates, and user-authored content generation with LLM assistance. It also included tools for managing chat logs, user tickets, and testing updates.

My role was to gather requirements, research solutions, and implement, deploy, and manage the system end-to-end.

Post-deployment on Tynker's parent and school pages, the chatbot significantly boosted user engagement, with higher conversion rates from users who interacted with it, indicating strong potential for further development.

## BYJU's Coding Cup

- **TLDR:** Soccer-themed coding competition for kids
- **Start:** 2023
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself + 1 Software Developer (match renderer) + multiple Game Designers (content development)
- **Platforms:** Web, Android (WebView), iOS (WebView)
- **Technologies:** React, PHP

The BYJU's Coding Cup was developed as a flagship product to highlight BYJU'S sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™. Aimed at children aged 7–18, this soccer-themed coding competition introduced key programming concepts like conditional logic and debugging in an interactive, fun format. Participants coded virtual soccer teams to compete globally, enhancing their coding skills through an engaging experience.

The project, completed in six months, leveraged parts of the [Crystal Clash](#crystal-clash) game engine to streamline development. The soccer matches were simulated in a discrete, grid-based environment, with fluid game flow achieved through clever interpolation of discrete states. Game mechanics, like skill levels influencing probabilistic events (e.g., ball steals), added strategic depth.

In my role, I ideated the game, architected the solution, and developed the backend engine, APIs, and most of the frontend (excluding match and character avatar rendering). I coordinated with another developer who handled match rendering to ensure smooth integration. I also optimized the game for performance on lower-end mobile devices.

Launched in time for the World Cup, the game was accessible via the web and integrated into Tynker Apps for iOS and Android through web views. It quickly gained popularity, with millions of matches played, and over $20,000 USD awarded in prizes during the first four rounds.

- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platform:** Web
- **Team:** Myself + Design Team + Content Team
- **Technologies:** React, MDX, NodeJS, React Native, PHP

The Quizzer platform is a versatile tool designed to build assessments that interleave multiple interactive quiz types, using a unified content authoring format powered by MDX.

The need for this system arose from the demand for more engaging and interactive quizzes that could be easily created and maintained. Initially, these quizzes were integrated into Tynker's content progression system as placement tests to onboard users at the right skill level, later evolving into assessment tests to ensure users were ready to progress to the next level.

MDX was used for modularity, allowing Quizzer to seamlessly integrate with various educational components, including interactive coding exercises.

My role was to architect and implement the full-stack solution, covering both frontend and backend development. I also developed a cross-platform native mobile prototype for Android and iOS using React Native, though this mobile version was shelved due to shifting priorities.

## Block IDE - Version 3.0

- **TLDR:** Major overhaul of Tynker's Block Editor
- **Start:** 2019
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web
- **Team:** Myself + Game Development Team (content upgrades)
- **Technologies:** Redux, Redux Saga, AngularJS, JavaScript, SCSS, PHP

In six months, I rearchitected a significant portion of Tynker's Block Editor, the core of its educational platform, to address critical scalability and maintenance issues caused by years of rushed development under tight deadlines, which had left the legacy codebase cluttered with hardcoded elements and quick-fix hacks, making it difficult to scale and maintain.

I implemented a new architecture based on a custom-built extension framework, Redux for state management, and Redux Saga for handling side effects. This solution improved scalability and future-proofed the platform. The extension framework modularized functionality, enforced separation of concerns, and introduced a clear lifecycle with declarative dependency management, significantly reducing maintenance overhead and simplifying feature additions. Redux decoupled UI state from the UI, and alongside the extension framework and Redux Saga, it streamlined scaling and enabled new features to be introduced with minimal changes across modules.

Looking back, a stack using PHP (for legacy reasons) + React (particularly with the release of React 16.8) + EmotionJS + the Extension Framework would have been more efficient. React could have replaced AngularJS, simplifying state management and eliminating the need for Redux. While Redux Saga was powerful, its steep learning curve for new developers would have made simpler alternatives preferable.

## Crystal Clash

- **TLDR:** Multiplayer turn-based battlebots game
- **Start:** 2018
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Crystal Clash is a multiplayer, turn-based battlebots game where players program their bots using Tynker's block-based programming language to compete in asynchronous matches. The game features monthly seasons, leaderboards, quests, and a shop where players can purchase new bot parts.

The core gameplay is similar to chess, taking place on an 8x8 grid arena where bots move, attack, and use special abilities. Matches are deterministic and the arena shrinks over time, with the objective of being the last bot standing. Players' bots follow scripts they code, which dictate their actions each turn.

To support the asynchronous gameplay and integrate Tynker's block-based programming language—originally designed for browser environments—I developed a server-side virtual machine that mirrors a subset of Tynker's features. This VM processes players' scripts to compute the game's next state.

Since its release, millions of matches have been played across numerous seasons.

- **Team:** Myself (Minecraft Editor) + Course Development Team (Mythicraft Course Content)
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Tynker's Mythicraft is a creative educational course designed to teach users how to mod their Minecraft world with a focus on mythological themes. It guides learners through the creation of custom skins, magical items, blocks, and mythical creatures.

This course marked the first integration of the Minecraft Editor tool into a standard Tynker course structure, blending traditional introductory lessons with those requiring the Minecraft Editor. To achieve this, I integrated the tool into the course workflows, enabling it to be declared in the course data structures, launched at the appropriate times, and embedded within the course frame. I also implemented lesson completion detection to trigger progression to the next lesson. Additionally, I optimized the editor's performance to enhance its functionality on native mobile apps, as the course was available on those platforms as well.

## Minecraft Editor

- **TLDR:** Web 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition
- **Start:** 2016
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself + Game Design Team (testing)
- **Technologies:** React, Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI, Pinecone

Developed a web-based 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, allowing users to customize Skins, Blocks, Items, and Mobs. The editor included texture editing capabilities and a block-based coding interface for Mob behaviors, inspired by Tynker's visual programming language, which translated user inputs into Minecraft's declarative configuration files.

A key challenge was optimizing performance on older iPad Mini models, where low frame rates and sluggish interactions were prevalent. To address this, I made sure I bypassed GPU compositing operations as much as possible, and implemented strict memory management strategies to mitigate the effects of unpredictable garbage collection. These optimizations ensured the editor ran smoothly within memory limits, achieving optimal frame rates.

The tool was integrated into both the Tynker App and the Mod Creator App, providing a powerful platform for Minecraft customizations. As of this writing, users have created several million assets using the editor.

## Nihonaid

- **TLDR:** Japanese Language Learning Assistant
- **Start:** 2006
- **Client:** Myself
- **Technologies:** C#, SQL Server, Neural Networks

Nihonaid is a tool I developed to assist with learning Japanese, specifically for memorizing the Kanji character set.

The app presented each character in order of complexity, prompting the user for its meaning. After revealing the correct meaning, the user would rate how well they remembered it. This feedback was processed by a Neural Network, which tracked the user's knowledge of each character and determined the optimal time to reintroduce it for review.

The system focused on characters the user either didn't know or was predicted to have forgotten. For example, if a user didn't recognize a character, the app would present it again in the next session. If the user remembered it, the app would space out the reviews progressively, showing it again in two days, then a week, and so on.

With this system, daily sessions ensured the user retained previously learned characters, as the app adapted to their individual learning and forgetting curve.

## Computer Capers

- **TLDR:** Adventure Game for the Commodore Amiga
- **Start:** 1996
- **Client:** Me
- **Technologies:** AMOS Basic

Computer Capers was a video game I developed at 12 years old and submitted to a monthly competition in Amiga Format magazine. Although the plot was simplistic and cringe, and the mechanics basic, I was proud of my accomplishment, especially given my age and having no internet access of any kind at the time. The game featured a tile-based world where players interacted with characters searching for specific items. By finding and trading these items, players advanced the storyline. I was particularly encouraged by the positive feedback I received from the magazine's contest reviewer.
