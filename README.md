Nurtered by the nostalgic screeching sounds of a ZX Spectrum loading games from an audio cassette, my journey into the digital realm began in the pre-internet dark ages, where knowledge was a treasure buried in dusty libraries and vintage magazines. By eight, armed with only my Casio Calculator and my wits, I began crafting text adventure games, lighting the first sparks of a lifelong passion for technology and programming. Progressing to the Commodore Amiga, a marvel ahead of its era yet tragically unsung, I progressed from hacking video games for infinite lives and ammo, to building them in BASIC, launching a game in Amiga Format magazine by the age of twelve. When I later got my hands on a PC, I was off to the races, disassembling executables to bypass trial limitations (allegedly), writing more video games, learning more coding languages, developing web apps, by the time I got to taking Computer Engineering in University, I was already well on my way. 

With a career that transitioned from a Lead Software Engineer at Tynker to co-founding Hive Solutions, I have deeply engaged with both technology and education. My work at Tynker, developing products for over 100 million students, and at Hive Solutions, has sharpened my skills in software development, project management, and DevOps. I bring a robust technical foundation, innovative mindset, and leadership to drive transformative projects. My journey showcases a commitment to excellence and a passion for leveraging technology in education, aiming to inspire and innovate with future collaborators.

# Education

## [University of Lodz](https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/)

- **Duration:** 2006 - 2007 (1 year of)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Software Engineering
- **Grade:** 18 (out of 20)

Took on Genetic Algorithms, Cryptography, Neural Networks, Network Services Programming and an Intensive course of Polish language, completing them with an average grade of 18 out of 20. The most enriching part of this experience was not the academics per se, but that of living in a melting pot of different cultures, with students from all around Europe, and having the opportunity to travel through Poland and neighbouring countries. 

I feel this short stay was more enriching on all levels, both personally and professionally, than anything that I could have found in Academia. There's something special about having to live for an extended period in a country whose language and culture are so different, and where almost no one communicates in your language (or English for that matter). You truly have to transcend your comfort zone just to get by, and having to do so was one of the most enriching experiences of my life.

## [Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/)

- **Duration:** 2002 - 2007 (5 year course)
- **Degree:** Licenciate, Software Engineering
- **Grade:** 16 (out of 20)

Activities and societies: Participated in ACM programming contests regularly.European Space Agency's ESMO project

This was arguably the best such course that could be found in my country, therefore the entry grades were relatively high. I started high school with a weak foundation in Mathemathics, so that complicated things quite a bit. However, I set my mind on that goal, put a picture of that Faculty on my study desk, and reversed the trend by the sweat of my brow, and ended up being admitted with excellent entry exam results.

The course was very work intensive. Assignments got bigger and bigger as semesters went by, and ended up growing to 80-100h work weeks by the last years. That amount was not required to make the grade, but me, like most people in the course, actually enjoyed the assignments, and wanted to make the most out of them. Making a 3D Video Game or a Neural Network that could distinguish objects when pointing a camera at them, and the all-nighters required to pull them off, are some of the assignments I vividly remember to this day.

# Projects

## Help Agent

- **TLDR:** Chatbot to assist users with inquiries related to Tynker
- **Start:** 2023
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Just me
- **Technologies:** React, Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI, Pinecone

Help Agent is a chatbot designed to assist users with inquiries related to Tynker, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This architecture enhances the chatbot's responses with custom data, grounding the information provided and minimizing inaccuracies. The development of such a system posed numerous challenges, including content scraping and parsing, data chunking and augmentation, embedding, indexing, querying, post-processing, reranking, model selection, and prompt engineering. Extensive experimentation was required to devise a solution that delivered fast, accurate, and reliable answers without compromising on safety or cost-effectiveness.

A backoffice system was also developed to support the chatbot's operations. This system facilitated the initial scraping of websites to gather data, management of these data sources, and periodic updates from each scraped URL. It enabled the creation of new user-authored documents with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs), including generation and summarization, as well as the uploading of additional documents (e.g., PDFs). Furthermore, the backoffice provided tools for reviewing chat logs, managing user tickets (e.g., reports of inadequate responses), and testing chatbot updates.

My role was to elicit requirements from stakeholders, research and experiment different solutions and finally to implement the solution end-to-end, deploy and manage it post-deployment.

Upon deployment on the Tynker's parent and school pages, the chatbot demonstrated a significant impact on user engagement. Metrics collected post-launch showed a high conversion rate among users who interacted with the chatbot, leading to sign-ups and/or purchases.

## BYJU's Coding Cup

- **TLDR:** Soccer-themed coding competition for kids
- **Start:** 2023
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web, Android (WebView), iOS (WebView)
- **Technologies:** PHP, React

The BYJU's Coding Cup was created as a flagship product to represent BYJU'S role as an official sponsor of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™. Targeted at children aged 7–18, this soccer-themed coding competition was designed to introduce key programming concepts such as conditional logic and debugging in an engaging, interactive format. By coding virtual soccer teams, participants could compete globally, enhancing their coding skills through a fun and educational experience.

The development process was completed in a remarkably short span of months, leveraging the game engine from [Crystal Clash](#crystal-clash). The soccer matches were simulated as a discrete, grid-based environment, achieving a seemingly fluid game flow through clever interpolation of discrete computed states. The introduction of game mechanics like assigning skill levels to players added depth, influencing probabilistic events such as ball steals.

In my role, I was responsible for conceptualizing the game, architecting the solution, coding the backend engine and APIs, and implementing the whole frontend except for the match rendering and some aspects of the character avatar rendering. This match rendering task was mostly fully handled by another developer, whose efforts I coordinated to ensure integration with the broader game infrastructure. Another key focus of mine was optimizing the game's performance and layout for a seamless mobile experience.

Successfully launched in time for the World Cup, the game was accessible via the web and integrated into Tynker Apps for iOS and Android through web views. It has since enjoyed widespread success, with millions of matches played across numerous rounds and a total prize pool exceeding $20,000 USD being awarded in the first four rounds.

## Live Classes

- **TLDR:** Platform for educators to conduct interactive coding classes with students
- **Start:** 2022
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Team:** Myself + Design Team
- **Platforms:** Web
- **Technologies:** PHP, React, WebRTC, Dyte

The Live Class platform was a tool that enabled educators to conduct interactive coding classes with students. The platform integrated with Tynker tools such as the Block IDE and other course content allowing teachers to seamlessly transition between live instruction and interactive coding exercises.

This requirement surfaced with the need to create a new product offering where we sold small course packages bundled with a number of lessons where an actual teacher would assist with that content over the span of a number of scheduled lessons.

My role was to quickly identify what the requirements for such an experience was, architect a solution and implement the full stack, backend and frontend as fast as possible.

The solution was deployed on schedule, with just a few minor hiccups mostly related to the video conferencing solution we integrated and a few cases of user mistakes.

## Quizzer

- **TLDR:** Modular quiz platform
- **Start:** 2021
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platform:** Web
- **Team:** Myself + Design Team + Content Team
- **Technologies:** PHP, React, MDX, NodeJS, React Native

The Quizzer platform is a versatile quiz platform that supports building assessments that interleave multiple interactive quiz types using a simple unified content authoring format powered by MDX. 

The need for building this system stemmed from the necessity of having more enticing and interactive quizzes that could be easily created and modified. Such quizzes would initially integrate into Tynker's content progression system in the form of placement tests that onboarded new users into the right skill level, and assessment tests that guardrailed if users were able to progress to the next education level or not.

This was achieved by incorporating MDX for modularity, enabling Quizzer to integrate effortlessly with different components of the educational stack, including interactive coding exercises. 

My role was to architect a solution and implement the full-stack, frontend and backend. Having also built a cross-platform native mobile prototype that ran on Android and iOS, built using React Native (the native mobile version was eventually backlogged and shelved due to a shift in priorities).

The solution was deployed on schedule, and remained a core part of content progression for the home user up to the day of this writing, with minimal maintenance requirements.

## Lynker

- **TLDR:** Real-time messaging server for Tynker
- **Start:** 2020
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Technologies:** NodeJS, Express, socket.io, Redis, NGINX

Beginning in 2020, I spearheaded the creation of the Lynker server for Tynker, a dynamic messaging server engineered to enhance real-time collaboration and notification processes. This project harnessed the power of NodeJS, Express, socket.io, Redis, and NGINX to enable a range of functionalities, from live dashboard notifications to project collaboration and multiplayer game development. Our design prioritized real-time updates, leveraging PM2 for efficient process management, Nginx for effective load balancing, Redis for fast message queuing, and MongoDB for reliable data storage. The architecture was carefully developed to support multi-tenancy, ensuring the system's scalability and adaptability in various environments. We implemented secure authentication through signed data from Tynker's API, providing controlled access based on user roles and permissions. While the server has proven its robustness in live applications, we are looking to further enhance its performance by shifting from Socket.io to native WebSockets and simplifying operations by phasing out status channels.

## Collaborative Learning System

- **TLDR:** Real-time project sharing and collaboration features for the Block IDE
- **Start:** 2020
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Technologies**: PHP, JavaScript, React, Redux, Redux Saga, socket.io

Using the Lynker messaging server I previously developed, augmented the Block IDE to have collaborative learning features, such as the ability to share projects, chat about them, comment on code, and monitor changes in real-time. This application was granted an [U.S. patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11699357B2).

## Block IDE - Version 3.0

- **TLDR:** Major overhaul of Tynker's Block Editor
- **Start:** 2019
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web
- **Technologies:** PHP, JavaScript, Redux, Redux Saga, AngularJS, SCSS

Performed a major overhaul of Tynker's Block Editor, at that time, the core of Tynker's educational platform, mostly alone, in the span of six months. Given the previous mistakes and the undefined nature of the project, where this tool could keep growing to more and more unknown use cases, started by defining an architecture that forced separation of concerns, since this was the previous version's biggest mistake. To do that, first developed an extension framework where every part of the codebase was encapsulated in an extension, which could specify its dependencies. This approach forced all code to be encapsulated in an extension, which had a pre-determined lifecycle, and forced declaritve specification of dependencies. The second big decision was to use Redux. Redux forces a separation of concerns between the UI State and the UI itself, while also

This project was a behemoth, it involved writing a lot of features from scratch. The ones that I barely touch were the very core, namely the VM and the Block Rendering.

Team: All software development tasks were architected and performed by me. There was also a significant effort to upgrade some curriculum to the new version, which was done by the game development team.
Looking back: Looking back I still think the extension framework and Redux Saga were good architectural decisions. The framework scaled great for new use cases, where most of the time one had only to create a new extension and perform minimal code changes across the others to develop the new feature. Coding with Redux Saga requires a paradigm shift and it was hard to onboard new people because of it. If I was comfortable with React at that time, and if version X was already available, I would just swap the whole stack with PHP + React + EmotionJS + Extension Framework + Redux Saga, and make a strong push for getting rid of Redux Saga completely if I was able to keep the application modular without it.

## Crystal Clash

- **TLDR:** Multiplayer turn-based battlebots game
- **Start:** 2018
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Crystal Clash is a multiplayer turn-based battlebots game that allows players to program their bots using Tynker's block-based programming language for competition in asynchronous matches. The game features monthly seasons, leaderboards, quests, and a shop where players can purchase new parts for their bots.

At its heart, Crystal Clash operates similarly to a complex chess game, set in an 8x8 grid arena where bots can move, attack, and deploy special abilities. Matches are resolved within a deterministic timeframe as the arena size decreases every few turns, aiming to be the last bot standing to win. The bots' actions are dictated by player-programmed scripts, executed each turn, to navigate and combat within the game environment.

To accommodate the game's asynchronous nature and the use of Tynker's block-based programming language, initially designed for client-side execution in browsers, I developed a specific server-side virtual machine (VM). This VM was tailored to interpret the game's unique programming language, ensuring seamless gameplay and script execution across platforms.

Popular to the time of this writing, several million matches have been played across numerous seasons.

## Mythicraft

- **TLDR**: Integration of Minecraft Editor into a new Tynker course.
- **Start:** 2017
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Platforms:** Web / iOS (WebView)

Tynker's Mythicraft is a creative and educational course designed to teach users how to mod their Minecraft world with a focus on mythological themes. It guides learners through the process of creating custom skins, magical items and blocks, and mythical creatures.

This was the first attempt at integrating the Minecraft Editor tool into the structure of a regular Tynker course, interweaving regular intro lessons with lessons that had to be performed in the Minecraft Editor itself. To do so, I had to integrate the tool into the course workflows such that it could be declared in a course structured, launched when it had to and inside the course frame, and support lesson completion detection to trigger a jump to the next lesson. Also further performance improvements had to be done in the editor to improve support in the native mobile apps, since this course was also available on them.

## Minecraft Editor

- **TLDR:** Web 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition
- **Start:** 2016
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer
- **Technologies:** React, Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI, Pinecone

Developed a web 3D editor for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, enabling customization of Skins, Blocks, Items, and Mobs. The editor featured texture editing and a block-based coding interface for Mob behaviors, inspired by Tynker's visual programming language, translating user inputs into Minecraft's declarative configuration files.

The project presented challenges in optimizing for performance on older iPad Mini models. Issues with low frame rates and sluggish interactions were addressed by reducing CSS layers and implementing stringent memory management strategies to mitigate unpredictable garbage collection impacts. These optimizations ensured smooth operation within memory limits and achieved optimal frame rates.

This tool was incorporated into the Tynker App and Mod Creator App, providing a robust platform for Minecraft customizations.

Popular to the time of this writing, several million assets have been created by users.

## Tynker - PHP MongoDB ODM

- **TLDR:** Custom MongoDB ODM for a legacy, unstructured PHP codebase
- **Start:** 2016
- **Client:** Tynker
- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer

Developed a custom MongoDB ODM for a legacy, unstructured PHP codebase to enforce object-oriented design principles. This initiative addressed significant code redundancy and facilitated the seamless transport of data and logic across the stack, which was previously unattainable due to a heterogeneous table-to-object mapping scheme and numerous database workarounds. Opting to create a tailored solution—completed in just a few days—yielded substantial long-term benefits, demonstrating remarkable return on investment through years of smooth operation with minimal issues.

However, this experience underscored the importance of cautious feature development aimed at maskinLg structural deficiencies. While the custom ODM effectively abstracted certain data model flaws, it inadvertently reduced the urgency to address these underlying issues directly. This approach allowed the data model's problems to persist and propagate throughout the stack, highlighting a critical lesson on balancing immediate solutions with the need for fundamental structural improvements.

## Windows Dev Center - App Middleware Partners

There was a lot of red tape to cut through in order to get hold of the required information to be able to integrate and deploy within the existing Microsoft infrastructure. This project started with a lot of unknowns that had to be solved by relentless cold calling different people on the organisational branch, in order to uncover the answer to all the questions. The project was delivered on time and on budget, against all challenges.

## Nihonaid

- **TLDR:** Japanese Language Learning Assistant
- **Start:** 2006
- **Client:** Myself
- **Technologies:** C#, SQL Server, Neural Networks

Nihonaid was a tool I developed to assist in my learning of the Japanese language, namely to memorize the Kanji character set. 

It presented the user with each character in order of complexity, and asked him for the meaning. The user then saw the meaning, and had to select how well he remembered it. The application would use this feedback and feed it into a Neural Network that kept track of how well the user new each character, and decided when was the best time to present it to the user again. 

This way, the software would only present the user with characters he didn't know, or that the application predicted he would probably had forgotten by then. For example, it would present a character the first time, and if the user said he didn't know the meaning at all, it would decide it would display it again in the next training session. In the next session the user could say he remembered it, and the application would decide to show it again in two days. In two days if the user remembered it again, then it would show it again in one week, and so on and so forth.

With this system in place, memorizing the characters was as easy as simply doing a daily session with the app, since it would make sure you didn't forget the characters you had previously learned, by progressively building a model on how your learning and forgetting curve were.

## Computer Capers

- **TLDR:** Adventure Game for the Commodore Amiga
- **Start:** 1996
- **Client:** Me
- **Technologies:** AMOS Basic

Computer Capers was a video game I developed when I was 12 years old and sent for a monthly competition on the Amiga Format magazine.

The whole game plot was incredibly dumb, which was natural for my age. The mechanics were very simple, you just walked around a tile-based world, talking to people who were looking for certain items, and when you found and gave them those items, they rewarded you with other items that other people were looking for, which let you advance the plot. The game graphics were created by me as well.
